It took me some hours to make my macOS 10.12 Sierra installation to not panic after plugging in arduino clones with CH340 USB2Serial chips. [This tzapu.com blog post](https://tzapu.com/ch340-ch341-serial-adapters-macos-sierra/) helped me. They also provide a [download link to a signed kernel extension for CH340 USB2Serial](http://blog.sengotta.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CH34x_Install_V1.3.zip) which I installed on my system.

Good luck!
